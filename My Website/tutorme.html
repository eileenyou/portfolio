        <p>In this project we aimed to design the UX for a novel idea of a native mobile skillsharing app on a smartphone. The design of the app should show thoughtful consideration for how the app can take advantage of in-device technologies (for example, camera, video, audio, NFC, accelerometer, GPS, fingerprint readers, voice recognition, etc.) to help provide users with a solution that meets their needs. </p>

        <h2>Focus</h2>
        <p> Our team decided to focus skillsharing to exchanging tutoring for specific classes at Carnegie Mellon. We performed a competitive analysis on skillsharing platforms like skillshare.com, vanywhere.com, clascity.com, etc. </p>
        <h2>Customer Journey Map</h2>
        <p> After the competitive analysis, we created personas and scenarios for students who are most likely to use our app. We created a customer journey map to flesh out the pain points and walk through the user's experience without this app.</p>

        <h2>App Flow</h2>
        <p> After identifying the pain points, we began to think about what features we wanted in our app and how we wanted the user to use our app. We mapped out an app flow, shown below:</p>

        <h2>Prototype</h2>
        <p> After building a low fidelity prototype and conducting user testing, we decided our low fidelity prototype didn't reach the aesthetic and functional standards that we needed. As a result, we revamped our app during the high fidelity phase to incorporate smartphone functions such as camera, calendar sync, push notifications, etc. </p>

        <h2>Reflection</h2>
        <p> This project made me realize that designs don't stand alone, they always interact with tools and other designs that already exist. It's much more powerful when a design you come up with is able to work well with already pervasive and good designs in the world.<br> It was difficult at first to think of ways to incorporate different smartphone functions. If I revisited the project I would definitely want to flesh out more features that this app could use. Another difficult part of this project was that I didn't know how detailed the high fidelity prototype had to be. We ended up creating a huge number of screens, but in our pitch we only used half of them. I now realize that if I had been trying to make a functional prototype, more screens would be necessary. However, for this project, less was probably more.</p>
