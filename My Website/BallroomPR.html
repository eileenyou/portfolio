          <h2>Fall Rush</h2>
          <p> Ballroom Fall Rush is hosted at the beginning of the academic year, when incoming first years gain their first exposure to our club. Since our target audience was experiencing a large transition in their lives, and one that I recently went through, I wanted to capture their migration from one home to another. I created promotional material that would emphasize the bonds that we made with each other because we were in this club.</p>

          <h2>Spring Rush</h2>
          <p> Ballroom Spring Rush is hosted the semester after Fall, and targeted mostly towards graduate students. Our target audience was a lot older, busier, and most of whome were looking for a fun outside activity. I tried to incorporate royal blues and bright coral reds to promote the elegance and festive nature of ballroom.</p>

          <p> I created a more engaging method of viewing ballroom, especially online. We released this video in facebook posts, events, and on our YouTube channel.</p>
